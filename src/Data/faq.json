    "question": "Why does my Mac sometimes lock or unlock even when my iPhone is not moving?",
    "answer": "<p>Near Lock uses the bluetooth signal strength along with an optimization algorithm for the distance estimation. The bluetooth signal strength varies depending on multiple factors (surrounding wifi, other bluetooth devices, humidity..) and an exact value can not be calculated.</p><p>What you can do is increase the Near Lock distance a bit to prevent your Mac from locking when your iPhone is not moving.</p>"

    "question": "I downloaded and opened Near Lock on my devices, but I'm stuck at the first screen.",
    "answer": "<p>Try restarting Near Lock on Mac.</p><p>Bluetooth signals can sometimes be lost in the crowd. Quit Near Lock from the menu bar icon and open it again. Give it a minute to find its bearings.</p><p>If that didn't help, reset Bluetooth on your devices:</p><br/><p>iOS (7.0 and up): The swipe up menu has a Bluetooth icon. Press once to turn off Bluetooth, press again to turn it on. Alternatively, you can go to Settings > Bluetooth and turn off/on from there.</p><br/><p>MAC: Click on the Bluetooth Icon on the top bar and select 'Turn Bluetooth Off'. Click again on the Icon and turn it back on.</p><p>If you still experiencing problems try restarting your Mac and iPhone - when the Bluetooth framework is faulty on the iPhone, the only way is to restart it.</p>"

    "question": "I linked my devices, but my Mac cannot see my iOS Device anymore.",
    "answer": "<p>First of all, make sure you haven't quit Near Lock from Multitasking menu.</p><p>Apple's latest iOS version forbids apps from running in the background mode when you manually quit them through Multitasking menu (which is accessed by double-tapping the home button). Check if Near Lock is open in the background mode, if it isn't you'll have to re-launch it for your iOS device to be visible to your Mac again.</p><p>Near Lock uses Low Energy Bluetooth technology to link your devices. On your iOS device, Bluetooth settings can be accessed by the swipe-up menu (for iOS 7.0 and above) or through Settings > Bluetooth.</p><p>If you still have problems, try to unlink devices on Mac and iOS.</p>First unlink your Mac by clicking on the Near Lock icon on the menu bar and then on 'Unlink' under setting menu. Your iPhone should unlink automatically. If it doesn't, unlink the iPhone app through the settings screen of your Mac by clicking on Unlink button, then Setup your Mac and iPhone again.</p>"
